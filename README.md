# EntechRomi
Romi project using Entech classes and robot organization.  This code is NOT complete.  It is meant as a training exercise for new programmers.

Exercises
 Hook up the drive subsystem to the joystick input
 Add output to SmartDashboard for drive subsystem status (e.g. gyro angle, speed, accelerations, ...)
 Provide a command that when a button on the joystick is pressed, moves the robot forward by 6 inches
 
 Create a OnBoardIO subsystem that extends EntechSubsystem and has access the LEDs (more details needed here)
 Provide a LED on/off method(s) for the subsystem
 Provide an EntechCommand (or commands) that turns the LED on/off
 Connect the LED to a button on the joystick.  The button can either be a toggle (press -> off -> press -> on) or hold on, relase off
 Make the previous command runs when robot is disabled
